# Question 5
# Let Y be a gamma random variable with parameters (s, α). That is, its density is
# f_Y(y) = Cy^(s-1)e^(-αy)
# where C is a constant. Suppose also that the distribution of X given that Y = y is Poisson with mean y. That is
# P_X(x) = (e^(-y)y^(x))/(x!)
# For x = 0, 1, 2, ... Show that the conditional distribution of Y given that X = x is the gamma distribution with
# parameters (s + x, α + 1).
